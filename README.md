Focused on a multi-project/ multi-environment scenario, the Community Build
Framework (CBF) is the way to setup and deploy Pentaho based applications.


If you work in several projects at the same time, or have to switch among
several environments (production, development, etc.), or need to customize the
Pentaho server (using different databases, changing the L&F, applying different
security types, etc.), CBF is the right tool for you.


CBF is an ant build file (build.xml). Check more extended documentation in
http://cbf.webdetails.org
