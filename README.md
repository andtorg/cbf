order to help deploying Pentaho BI server. Original versions can be

##### CBF - Community Build Framework

This ant build file (build.xml) Focused on a multi-project/ multi-environment scenario, the Community Build
Framework (CBF) is the way to setup and deploy Pentaho based applications.


If you work in several projects at the same time, or have to switch among
several environments (production, development, etc.), or need to customize the
Pentaho server (using different databases, changing the L&F, applying different
security types, etc.), CBF is the right tool for you.


CBF is an ant build file (build.xml). Check more extended documentation in
http://cbf.webdetails.org

##### Ctools-downloader

A shell script that downloads stable components from the Internet and create a local filesystem
repository for future deployment.

At prompt, launch
    ./ctools-downloader.sh
to see the options for downloading.
